# Luis Cruz Portfolio Website

Portfolio website made with the React framework

## Project Description

This project is a website to house all the links to my projects on Github, as well as describe me as a person.

It uses the react framework to help create components that will display when specific routes are called. I used react because it is the framework I am most familiar with (for now) and because it is great for making web applications.

While working on this project I did run into some challenges including:

- Design
  - The design of the website had to be clean and consistent. To overcome this issue I had to experiment with different looks and checked examples online (I'm not an artist)
- Layout
  - Getting the layout of the site was important. I needed to know how each route would update the DOM and which components would be displayed.
